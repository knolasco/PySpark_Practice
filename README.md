# Introduction

The purpose of this mini-project was to familiarize myself with the PySpark API. I practiced by reading in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website) from Kaggle.com.

I answered a few questions I had about the dataset before building a linear regression model to try to predict the yearly amount spent. I was able to obtain a RMSE score of 10.34. In context, this means the regressor was off by about $10.34 on average. Considering that the average yearly amount spent was about $500.00, I believe that $10 is a pretty small error.

Please take a look at the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/knolasco/PySpark_Practice/blob/main/PySpark_Practice.ipynb).

Thank you for your time.
